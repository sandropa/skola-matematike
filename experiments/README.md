# Skola Matematike - API Experiments

This directory contains various experiments related to data analysis, model evaluation, and exploration for the Skola Matematike API project. Each subdirectory represents a distinct experiment.

## Structure

- `src/`: Contains shared Python utility functions used across multiple experiments (e.g., interacting with Gemini API, common plotting functions).
- `01_embedding_pca_visualization/`: Experiment to visualize Gemini text embeddings of IMO Shortlist problems using PCA to understand semantic clustering by category (Algebra, Number Theory, Geometry, Combinatorics).
- `02_.../`: (Placeholder for future experiments)
